<p>Hello, I’m <strong>Anna, Shiyu Tao</strong>. I was born in <em>Fujian</em> in <em>Mainland China</em> and then went to <em>Hong Kong</em> to pursue my undergraduate study in accounting and finance. During that time, I also attended a semester exchange in <em>The University of Manchester</em> and a summer exchange in <em>The University of British Columbia</em>. Both were amazing experiences and I’m very looking forward to the journey in <strong>London Business School</strong>! This is my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-shiyu-tao">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>Besides, I love reading, Chinese painting, playing piano, swimming and travelling! I am also a foodie and always attracted by different kinds of food.</p>
