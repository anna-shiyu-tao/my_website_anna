You may find useful the material on [finance data sources](https://mfa2021.netlify.app/reference/finance_data/). 

We will use the `tidyquant` package to download historical data of stock prices, calculate returns, and examine the distribution of returns. 

We must first identify which stocks we want to download data for, and for this we must know their ticker symbol; Apple is known as AAPL, Microsoft as MSFT, McDonald's as MCD, etc. The file `nyse.csv` contains 508 stocks listed on the NYSE, their ticker `symbol`, `name`, the IPO  (Initial Public Offering) year, and the sector and industry the company is in.


```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nyse <- read_csv(here::here("data","nyse.csv"))
glimpse((nyse))
```

Based on this dataset, create a table and a bar plot that shows the number of companies per sector, in descending order

```{r companies_per_sector}

companies_per_sector <- nyse %>%
  group_by((sector)) %>%
  count(sector) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

companies_per_sector

ggplot(companies_per_sector, aes(x=reorder(sector,-n), y=n)) +
  labs(title = "No. of Companies per Sector",
      x = "Sector",
      y = "No. of Companies") +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=50, size=15, vjust=0.5)) +
  geom_col() +
  NULL

```

Next, let's choose the [Dow Jones Industrial Aveareg (DJIA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average) stocks and their ticker symbols and download some data. Besides the thirty stocks that make up the DJIA, we will also add `SPY` which is an SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund).







```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Notice the cache=TRUE argument in the chunk options. Because getting data is time consuming, # cache=TRUE means that once it downloads data, the chunk will not run again next time you knit your Rmd

#myStocks <- tickers %>% 
#  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
#         from = "2000-01-01",
#         to   = "2020-08-31") %>%
#  group_by(symbol) 

#Took too long to group_by, thus directly use the myStocks.csv

myStocks <- read.csv(here::here("data","myStocks.csv"))
myStocks <- myStocks %>%
  select(-1) %>% 
  group_by(symbol)
  
myStocks$date=ymd(myStocks$date)

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

Financial performance analysis depend on returns; If I buy a stock today for 100 and I sell it tomorrow for 101.75, my one-day return, assuming no transaction costs, is 1.75%. So given the adjusted closing prices, our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns.


```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```

Create a dataframe and assign it to a new object, where you summarise monthly returns since 2017-01-01 for each of the stocks and `SPY`; min, max, median, mean, SD.

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}

summarise_monthly_returns <- myStocks_returns_monthly %>%
  filter(date > "2016-12-31") %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  summarise(min_return=min(monthly_returns), 
          max_return=max(monthly_returns), 
          median_return=median(monthly_returns),
          mean_return=mean(monthly_returns),
          sd_return=sd(monthly_returns))

summarise_monthly_returns
# SPY is in the table.

```


Plot a density plot, using `geom_density()`, for each of the stocks
```{r density_monthly_returns}

density_monthly_returns <- ggplot(myStocks_returns_monthly, aes(x=monthly_returns) ) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_wrap(~symbol) +
  theme_stata()
  NULL

density_monthly_returns

```


We can see most of the stocks have monthly returns concentrated near 0, with some skewed slight to the left or right. The S&P 500 has the narrowest and steepest density plot. This confirms our hypothesis that it is the least volatile as it is comprised of 500 large-cap companies that are in diverse sectors. Looking at individual stocks, the riskiest is Dow Inc. (DOW), as its density plot is the flattest. This indicates that its recorded monthly returns are dispersed and can vary signifcantly from month to month. The least risky stock is Microsoft (MSFT), which similar to SPY, has a narrow and steep curve. This indicates that there is a low variance on monthly returns.


Finally, produce a plot that shows the expected monthly return (mean) of a stock on the Y axis and the risk (standard deviation) in the X-axis. Please use `ggrepel::geom_text_repel()` to label each stock with its ticker symbol

```{r risk_return_plot}

library(ggrepel)
ggplot(summarise_monthly_returns, aes(x = sd_return, y = mean_return)) + 
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = symbol), size = 3)+
    labs(title = "Risk-Return Profile of Selected Stocks since 2017", x = "Mean Monthly Standard Deviation", y = "Mean Monthly Return")+
  geom_point() +
  theme_stata()
  NULL

```


This plot indicates that most companies offer a similar risk-return profile with a standard deviation of returns under 0.08 and a mean monthly return of 0.01 to 0.02. However, there are some outliers present. For example, WBA's standard deviation of returns is close to 0.075, but its monthly mean return is almost -0.015. Other companies with a similar risk return profile bucket offer a much higher mean monthly return. Other outliers include DOW and BA, which have a monthly mean return of around 0.01, but compared to other companies offering a similar return, their monthly return standard deviation is much higher at 0.12 to 0.13.
